### Temporary Email via API

A temporary email application works by generating a temporary email address that you can use for a specific purpose. such as:
<b> Verification</b> 
Temporary email addresses are commonly used for signing up for new accounts or resetting passwords. Users can generate a temporary email address for verification purposes instead of using a permanent one.
<b> Privacy and Spam Prevention</b> 
By using temporary email addresses, users can receive emails without revealing their personal or permanent email addresses. These temporary emails usually have a limited lifespan, which helps protect privacy and avoid spam in online activities.

## Architecture of our system
