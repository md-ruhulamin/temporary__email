# Temporary Email via API

Temporary email application works by generating a temporary email address that you can use for a specific purpose. such as:

## Verification 
Temporary email addresses are commonly used for signing up for new accounts or resetting passwords. Instead of using a permanent email address, users can generate a temporary one for verification purposes.
## Privacy and Spam Prevention
By using temporary email addresses, users can receive emails without revealing their personal or permanent email address. These temporary emails usually have a limited lifespan, which helps protect privacy and avoid spam in online activities.
